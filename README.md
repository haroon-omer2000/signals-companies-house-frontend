# 🧠 AI-Powered UK Company Financial Insights

A modern web application that provides AI-powered analysis of UK company filings using Companies House API and OpenAI integration.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Company Search**: Users search for UK companies by name or number using the Companies House Search API
2. **Filing Retrieval**: The app fetches the 6 most recent financial filings (accounts, annual returns, confirmation statements)
3. **Document Analysis**: Documents are downloaded and parsed for AI analysis
4. **AI Insights**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo generates comprehensive summaries and insights from document content
5. **Trends Dashboard**: Visual charts show filing patterns and compliance health over time

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: RTK Query for efficient API caching and state management
- **UI Components**: Mantine UI with custom animations and responsive design
- **Data Source**: Companies House API with secure proxy routes
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for document analysis and summarization
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

## ✅ Core Requirements - Implemented

### 1. Company Search Interface
- ✅ Search by company name or number
- ✅ Fetch matching companies via Companies House API
- ✅ Display company details (name, number, status, incorporation date)

### 2. Document Retrieval
- ✅ Pull last 6 filings with financial prioritization
- ✅ Filter for accounts, annual returns, and confirmation statements
- ✅ Download documents (PDF/HTML) via Companies House Document API

### 3. AI Summary
- ✅ Extract core information from documents
- ✅ Generate 1-paragraph summaries per document using OpenAI
- ✅ Structured analysis with key insights and financial highlights
- ✅ Download AI summaries as PDF reports

### 4. UI Display
- ✅ Clear, readable layout with modern design
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices

## 🎨 Optional/Bonus Features - Implemented

### Enhanced UI/UX
- ✅ Modern animated design with Framer Motion
- ✅ Debounced search for performance
- ✅ Comprehensive loading animations and skeleton states
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Technical Enhancements
- ✅ RTK Query for efficient state management
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Secure API route proxies
- ✅ Environment configuration management
- ✅ Next.js 15 compatibility with async params

### Advanced Features
- ✅ **Filing Trends Dashboard**: Visual charts showing filing patterns over time
- ✅ **Financial Health Score**: Algorithm-based compliance scoring (0-100)
- ✅ **Streaming Downloads**: Optimized large file downloads
- ✅ **Adaptive Loading States**: Smart timing for download progress

## 🔧 Assumptions Made

1. **Document Parsing**: PDF text extraction was limited due to library compatibility issues in Next.js environment
2. **API Rate Limits**: Companies House API has generous limits for development use
3. **File Sizes**: Large PDFs (10MB+) are handled with streaming for performance
4. **Data Availability**: Some companies may have limited filing history
5. **AI Analysis**: Fallback to enhanced metadata analysis when document content unavailable

## 🚫 What Didn't Work & Why

### PDF Text Extraction
- **Issue**: `pdf-parse` library caused `ENOENT` errors in Next.js environment
- **Impact**: AI analysis falls back to metadata-based summaries for PDFs
- **Solution**: Implemented robust fallback system with enhanced filing analysis

### OpenAI Model Access
- **Issue**: Initial `gpt-4` model returned 404 errors
- **Impact**: Switched to `gpt-3.5-turbo` for reliable access
- **Solution**: Model change maintained quality while ensuring availability

### CSS Conflicts
- **Issue**: Mantine and Tailwind CSS conflicts caused invisible elements
- **Impact**: Simplified styling approach with inline styles
- **Solution**: Removed complex CSS layers, used direct styling for stability

## 📊 Data Visualization Features (Besides the requirements)

### Filing Trends Dashboard
- Monthly filing activity charts (last 12 months)
- Filing type distribution pie charts
- Key metrics: total filings, recent activity, average per year
- Automated insights based on filing patterns

### Financial Health Score
- Algorithm scoring based on:
  - Filing recency (30 points)
  - Filing frequency (25 points)
  - Document types (25 points)
  - Document quality (20 points)
- Visual score display with color-coded compliance status
- Health insights and recommendations

## 🔐 Security & Performance

- **API Key Protection**: All external API calls proxied through secure backend routes
- **Streaming Downloads**: Large files streamed directly without server buffering
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in debouncing and request management

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Feature Enhancements
- **Trends Summary**: Aggregate insights across multiple documents
- **Email Sharing**: Send summaries via Resend integration
- **Supabase Integration**: Caching and search history

### Architecture & Scalability Improvements
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate Express.js backend for primary API and FastAPI for AI processing
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for data persistence
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for API response caching and session management
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ/Redis for async AI processing tasks
- **API Gateway**: Kong or AWS API Gateway for rate limiting and authentication
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling with multiple server instances

### Development & Operations
- **Testing Suite**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E, and API testing with Supertest
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring with DataDog or New Relic
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston and centralized log management
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, and API key rotation
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all API endpoints

### Performance Optimizations
- **CDN Integration**: CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront for static assets
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization and connection pooling
